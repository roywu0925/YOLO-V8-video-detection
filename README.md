#  README â€“ YOLOv8 Real-Time People Detection

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates **real-time people detection** in videos using the **YOLOv8n** pretrained model. A video input is processed frame by frame, detecting persons (class ID = 0) and drawing bounding boxes with confidence scores. The project leverages **Ultralytics YOLOv8**, **OpenCV**, and **NumPy**.

Use case: Surveillance, crowd monitoring, or any application where identifying humans in video streams is critical.

##  Key Concepts

* **Model**: YOLOv8n (Ultralytics) pretrained on COCO dataset
* **Target Class**: `person` (class ID = 0)
* **Frameworks**: Ultralytics, OpenCV, NumPy
* **Detection Flow**:

  1. Load pretrained YOLOv8n model
  2. Read video input frame by frame
  3. Run detection â†’ filter for `person` class
  4. Draw bounding boxes + confidence scores
  5. Display results in real-time
